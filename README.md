# Thijs-Anglim-Final-Project-MTG-Draft-Data-Analysis
### The final project for CMP262 Data Science is a data analysis on a csv file representing data of individual cards from Magic The Gathering Arena's "Outlaws of Thunder Junction" expansion. The data has each card represented by their name, color and performance in the draft format.
### The mtgOutlawCards.csv is the initial data set sourced from Kaggle. This data represents all of the cards from the "Outlaws" expansion.
### The dfMtg is the cleaned version of data that I used to perform my analysis.
### The ipynb notebook contains my research questions, graphs and analysis
